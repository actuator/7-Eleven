In 2018 7-Eleven had a limited promotional item distributed called the 'Custom Message Cup’.
Customers could personalize their cups with their  own messages, slogans, or artwork using a template provided by 7-Eleven & was available in various sizes.

The cup consists of a plastic shell lined with an LED strip that communicates via BlueTooth Low Energy & allows users to send messages from thier mobile device & is available for Android & iOs.

Neither the manufacturer Whirley DrinkWorks, nor 7-Eleven disclosed the undocumented word filter restriction on this promotional cup, but it was soon apparent a wide array of words were filtered using asterixis '*'.

Searching the source via JADX-GUI revealed the de-facto list of vulgar words & the regex word filter accomplished via  client-side filtering so I then proceeded to edit that wordlist.

APK Easy Tool was effective in providing a turn-key solution to decompile, sign & recompile the 'Hello Cup'(v1.3.1) Application.

The first step was to  retrieve the Smali resources which is essentially a specialized assembly language that is used to represent the Dalvik bytecode of Android application & is specific to the Android runtime environment & not directly related to traditional assembly languages like x86 or ARM assembly.

Because I am boycotting ‘Pokemon GO’ only the string 'pogo' will be restricted & everything else previously banned such as 'ugly' (really?) will no longer be filtered.

As a result the message 'ugly pogo stick' previously rendered as '**** pogo stick' will now displaying 'ugly **** stick'.

Modifying the application was trivial; it however served as an interesting illustration for people learning like myself of bypassing client-side filtering restraints.
